## CB4J
CSV Batch 4 Java is a framework that aims at simplifying CSV files batch processing with Java.
CB4J uses a POJO-based development approach which lets you process CSV files with an object oriented view of records.
The framework addresses common tedious tasks such as reading, parsing and validating CSV records and lets you concentrate on your batch processing business logic.
