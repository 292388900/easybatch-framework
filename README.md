Easy Batch is a framework that aims to simplify batch processing with Java.

It addresses common tedious tasks such as reading, filtering, parsing and validating input data and lets you keep focus on your batch processing business logic.

## Key features

 * Lightweight: The framework's core has no dependencies and hence a small memory footprint : a 80Ko jar file with a lot of features.

 * POJO-oriented development: Map records to your domain objects so you can still work with the Object Oriented aspect of Java.

 * Declarative data validation: Declare data validation constraints on your domain objects and let Easy Batch handle the validation code for you.

 * Easy to learn and use: Easy Batch uses a simple and natural data model and API. You can learn it easily and start using it quickly.

 * Statistics reporting: Easy Batch provides a simple and customizable reporting tools for common statistics including validation errors and processing time.

 * JMX monitoring: Monitor your batch execution and progress using JMX at runtime and in real time.

 * Parallel execution: Run multiple engine instances in parallel to speed up execution and reduce processing time.
