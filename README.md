 * Easy to learn and use : Easy Batch uses a simple and natural data model and API. You can learn it easily and start using it quickly.

 * Statistics reporting : Easy Batch provides a simple and customizable reporting tools for common statistics including validation errors and processing time.

 * JMX monitoring : Monitor your batch execution and progress using JMX at runtime and in real time.
