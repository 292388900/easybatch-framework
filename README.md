Easy Batch is a framework that aims to simplify batch processing with Java.

It addresses common tedious tasks such as reading, filtering, parsing and validating input data and lets you keep focus on your batch processing business logic.

Let's see a quick example. Suppose you have the following `tweets.csv` file:

```
id,user,message
1,foo,hello
2,bar,@foo hi!
```

and you would like to transform these tweets to XML format. Here is how you can do that with Easy Batch:

```java
Engine engine = new EngineBuilder()
        .reader(new FlatFileRecordReader("tweets.csv"))
        .filter(new HeaderRecordFilter())
        .mapper(new DelimitedRecordMapper(Tweet.class, new String[]{"id", "user", "message"}))
        .processor(new XmlRecordMarshaller(Tweet.class))
        .writer(new FileRecordWriter("tweets.xml"))
        .build();

Report report = engine.call();
```

In this example, we have created a engine that:

* reads flat records one by one from the input file `tweets.csv`
* filter the header record (that contains field names)
* map each tweet to an instance of the `Tweet` bean
* transform the tweet to XML format 
* and finally write this XML to an output file `tweets.xml`

At the end of execution, we get a report with statistics about the job run (Number of errors, execution time, etc).

All the boilerplate code of resources I/O, filtering and parsing records, mapping data to the domain object `Tweet`, writing output and reporting
 is handled by Easy Batch.
 
## Key features

 * Lightweight: The framework's core has no dependencies and hence a small memory footprint : a 100Ko jar file with a lot of features.

 * Easy to learn and use: Easy Batch uses a simple and natural data model and API. You can learn it easily and start using it quickly.
 
 * POJO-oriented development: Map records to your domain objects so you can still work with the Object Oriented aspect of Java.

 * Declarative data validation: Declare data validation constraints on your domain objects and let Easy Batch handle the validation code for you.

 * Statistics reporting: Easy Batch provides a simple and customizable reporting tools for common statistics including validation errors and processing time.

 * JMX monitoring: Monitor your batch execution and progress using JMX at runtime and in real time.

 * Parallel execution: Run multiple engine instances in parallel to speed up execution and reduce processing time.
