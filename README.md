## What is CB4J?

CSV Batch 4 Java is a framework that aims to simplify CSV files batch processing with Java.

CB4J addresses common tedious tasks such as reading, parsing and validating CSV records and lets you concentrate on your batch processing business logic.

## Key features

 * Lightweight framework : CB4J has no dependencies and hence a small memory footprint : a 70Ko jar file with a lot of features!

 * POJO-based development : Map CSV records to your domain objects so you can still work with the Object Oriented aspect of Java.</p>

 * Declarative data validation : CB4J lets you declare data validation constraints with extensible built-in validators for common requirements.

 * Easy to learn and use : CB4J uses a simple and natural CSV model and API. You can learn it easily and start using it quickly.

 * Statistics reporting : CB4J provides a customizable reporting for common statistics including validation errors and processing time.

 * JMX monitoring : Monitor your batch execution and progress using JMX at runtime and in real time.
